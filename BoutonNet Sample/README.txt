This folder is intended to verify that you have correctly installed BoutonNet

You should be able to run BoutonNet on this folder. Navigate to the folder containing BoutonNet.py in command prompt.
Run the command 'python BoutonCount.py -e "BoutonNet Sample" -p'

This should create another image in this folder, called "Boutons.png". If this file is the same as "Correct Boutons.png", then the program has successfully worked
