Olympus VS200 Imaging. For comparison, two slides were imaged with a 40x objective on an Olympus VS200 slide-scanning microscope, calibrated for brightfield slide-scanning. To image through the entire section, we used the default “Transmitted Light Exponential” Extended focusing algorithm to image 31 planes 1 μm apart. Lamp intensity was set at 70%. We used a 40x UPLXAPO 40x oil objective, with a numerical aperture of 1.4. We used a 16-bit iDS VS-264C camera. For use with BoutonNet, images were resized using bicubic interpolation to a resolution of 345 nm/pixel.
Axio Imager M.2 Imaging. For comparison, sections were imaged with a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope and 8-bit QImaging 2000R camera. Images were taken at 40X with an oil objective, with 20 focal planes each 1 um apart. Images were taken after Köhler illumination, with both the condenser and luminous field diaphragm fully opened. These images were then collapsed using the ImageJ Extended Depth of Field plugin. The clarity of the images was increased with ImageJ’s Enhance Local Contrast (CLAHE) filter, before being stitched together and converted to greyscale. Images were resized using bicubic interpolation to the same resolution of 345 nm/pixel.
